            <li>They can transfer thoughts in two directions once activated if used alone.</li>
            <li>If used with another device, they can transfer one's consciousness to another body.</li>
            <li>If both stones are used with another device, the consciousnesses switch bodies.</li>

    <p>Dudley was ninety-two, in his second life, and fast approaching time for another rejuvenation. Despite his body having the physical age of a standard fifty-year-old, the prospect of a long degrading campaign within academia was one he regarded with dread. For a supposedly advanced civilization, the Intersolar Commonwealth could be appallingly backward at times, not to mention cruel.</p>
    <p><i>Maybe it won't be that bad</i>, he told himself. The lie was comforting enough to get him through the rest of the night's shift.

    <p>The Carlton AllLander drove Dudley home just after dawn. Like the astronomer, the vehicle was old and worn, but perfectly capable of doing its job. It had a cheap diesel engine, common enough on a semi-frontier world like Gralmond, although its drive array was a thoroughly modern photoneural processor. With its high suspension and deep-tread tyres it could plough along the dirt track to the observatory in all weather and seasons, including the metre-deep snow of Gralmond's winters.</p>
